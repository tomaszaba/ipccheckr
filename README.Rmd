## Background

IPC AMN is a global tool that uses a set o protocols to classify geographical areas into a 5-phases severity based on the prevalence of acute malnutrition among children aged 6:59 months. Its main objective is to provide actionable information for decision-makers. It is not a data collection method _per se_, therefore, it relies on evidence generated through other methods (representative surveys, screening, sentinel sites, etc). Before any evidence is used an IPC AMN analysis, checks must performed to ascertain the quality of data, following the minimum quality standards set in the protocol, hence its reliability. As such, only evidence that pass the checks are allowed to be used in an IPC analysis exercise.

## Why `ipccheckr`?

The typical analysis workflow is overly complex, tiring and tedious, time-consuming and not not reproducible. Oftentimes, due to demand, the workflow needs to be implemented on a pile of data in absolute short time, making the process prone to human errors due to fatigue. In the workflow, data “checker” needs to travel from software to software as follows: SPSS software (mostly) to process data and export to Excel or CSV to then import it into Emergency Nutrition Assessments (ENA) for SMART software for to run the quality. From this stage downstream, the workflow needs to be done one-by-one for the number of survey area a data set may hold: run the quality check, then transfer the summary results into a summary table (Excel spreadsheet or other). Then, run the prevalence analysis (also one-by-one), and then transfer the results into a spreadsheet and so on and so forth. Sometimes, a fourth tool is used to correct for a likely overestimation of acute malnutrition prevalence based on MUAC when there are excess of younger children (6:23 months) over older children (24:59 months) in the sample. Therefore, the `ipccheckr` was developed simply to make the workflow simpler, joyful and reproducible thanks to its array of handy functions.

## What does `ipccheckr` do?

In a nutshell, the array of exported functions span from sample size checkers, data processors, quality checkers, prevalence calculators as well as some handy functions to render formatted and presentable output tables on the two latter groups of functions.

### Plausibility checks with `ipccheckr`

You can run plausibility checks on: 

  + Weight-for-height z-score (WFHZ) data
  + MUAC-for-age z-score (MFAZ) data _when **age** variable **is** available_ 
  + Absolute values of MUAC data _when **age** variable **is not** available_ 

#### Useful workflow with `ipccheckr` for data quality check
```{r ipccheckr_workflow, echo=FALSE, fig.align='default'}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph ipccheckr {
  # Default node attributes
  node [style = filled, color = lightblue, fontname = Helvetica, fontsize = 12];

  # Nodes
  node1 [label = 'Start', shape = ellipse, color = PaleGreen];
  node2 [label = 'Anthro data', shape = parallelogram];
  node3 [label = 'Check sample size requirements', shape = box];
  node4 [label = 'Met?', shape = diamond, color = lightgoldenrod];
  yes [label = 'Yes', shape = note]
  no [label = 'No', shape = note]
  
  # Nodes for YES branch ----
  node5 [label = 'Indicator', shape = diamond, color = lightgoldenrod];
  node6 [label = 'WFHZ', shape = note];
  node7 [label = 'MFAZ', shape = note];
  node8 [label = 'MUAC', shape = note];
  node9 [label = 'Process age', shape = box];
  node10 [label = 'Process data', shape = box];
  node11 [label = 'Check plausibility', shape = box];

  # Node for NO branch ----
  node12 [label = 'End of workflow', shape = oval, color = salmon];

  ## Data process ----
  node1 -> node2 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  node2 -> node3 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  node3 -> node4 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  node4 -> no [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  no -> node12 [lable = 'NO', color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  
  ## Workflow for Yes WFZH ----
  node4 -> yes [color = gray, arrowhead = vee]
  yes -> node5 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  node5 -> node6 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  node6 -> node9 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  node9 -> node10 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  node10 -> node11 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  node11 -> node12 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  
   ## Workflow for Yes MFAZ ----
  node5 -> node7 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  node7 -> node9 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  node9 -> node10 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  node10 -> node11 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  node11 -> node12 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  
  ## Workflow for Yes MUAC ----
  node5 -> node8 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  node8 -> node10 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  node10 -> node11 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
  node11 -> node12 [color = gray, arrowhead = vee];
}

### On the prevalence analysis

After the data quality checks workflow, you will now be in position to decide whether or not you can proceed to the prevalence analysis. The workflow is quite simple: you use the data returned by the data processors in the above workflow. `ipccheckr` can compute acute malnutrition prevalence based on:

  + WFHZ and/or edema - guide
  + MUAC and/or edema - guide
  + Combined prevalence (of WFHZ and MUAC and edema) - guide
  + MFAZ and/or edema - guide

::: tip
Despite the fact that this package was designed with the idea of simplifying the IPC AMN checks workflow in mind, you can absolutely use its utilities beyond this scope. For instance, if you are undertaking a research and you want to censor your data before including in your statistical models, etc, you can use this packages utilities for that.

::: warning
Please note that `ipccheckr` is still highly experimental and is undergoing a lot of development. Hence, any functionalities described below have a high likelihood of changing interface or approach as we aim for a stable working version.
